# Bayesian-Forest-Fire-Analysis

In the past couple years, forest ﬁres have seemed more prevalent especially in the West. Experiences like the campﬁre in Paradise California in 2018 cause drastic economic and ecological damage. Understanding factors that play in forest ﬁres will help mitigate damage caused by the ﬁre, and help prevent future ﬁres. The goal of this analysis is to better understand the factors that play into forest ﬁres and what causes them to be more harmful by utilizing Bayesian techniques. I utilize a hierarchical Bayesian model to model the total area burned in Monteshino National Park in Portugal. The model is basically a combination of linear and logistic regression and I use MCMC to obtain draws from the posterior distribution.
